## 🌐 What is “Onchain Life”?

When we moved finance onchain, DeFi was born.

When we moved art onchain, NFTs emerged.

So, what happens when we move **life** onchain?

This casual hackathon initiated by **LXDAO** aims to bring everyday imagination into the blockchain world—not for hype or headlines, but to sketch out drafts of the future.

## 💡 Why are we doing this?

Blockchain isn’t just a trading tool. It can become part of how we *live*.

LXDAO is dedicated to "making valuable projects happen continuously."

We believe that **onchain life scenarios** could become one of the most meaningful and imaginative frontiers in the next five years.

This summer, no business plans, no Web3 whitepapers—just one relaxed yet intentional hackathon to unlock a new narrative of life.

🛠️ **What kind of ideas are we looking for?** (but not limited to these)

- 🏡 Onchain Families: Marriage contracts, family DAOs, onchain kinship relations

- 📜 Onchain Wills & Inheritance: Trustworthy custody and digital legacy mechanisms

- 🐶 Onchain Pets & Identity Systems: Creating unique onchain identities for our furry friends

- 💕 Onchain Love Life: Dating contracts, breakup insurance, couple treasury

- 🧓 Life, Aging, Health & Death: Onchain health data, retirement DAOs, mutual aid for illness

- 🛠️ Urban DAOs & Social Governance: How can local communities operate onchain?

- 🧠 Bolder Ideas: Onchain college applications, rental credit scoring, blockchain memorial halls…

This is a bold, relaxed, and non-grindy hackathon. You don’t need technical mastery—we welcome **cross-disciplinary creativity**.

Even if you don’t code, you can design an interface in Figma, write a proposal, or make a demo video. What we want is **proof of concept + imagination**!
