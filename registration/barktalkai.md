project_description: 'BarkTalKAI is a quick-start tool dApp designed for novice dog owners. Its core feature leverages smartphone cameras to perform real-time analysis of canine body language, utilizing AI algorithms to intelligently assess pets' behavioral intentions and provide interactive guidance. The platform aims to create an intelligent communication Web3 application (DogLifeHelper) bridging humans and pets. Building upon DogLifeHelper's core functionalities, BarkTalKAI will evolve into a Web3 community integrating a forum (BBS), pet adoption services, and a pet product marketplace (MALL). It caters precisely to pet enthusiasts, pet healthcare institutions, and pet product consumers, forging a vertical ecosystem platform that combines pet behavior management, social engagement, and commercial services. Subsequently, the team plans to develop DogLifeHelper VR glasses based on the mature application, offering dog owners an innovative human-canine interaction experience through AR technology while laying the technical groundwork for future AR pet-raising games.' # Brief description about your project in one sentence
