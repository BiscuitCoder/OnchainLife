## 🌐 What is “Onchain Life”?

When we moved finance onchain, DeFi was born.

When we moved art onchain, NFTs emerged.

So, what happens when we move **life** onchain?

This casual hackathon initiated by **LXDAO** aims to bring everyday imagination into the blockchain world, not for hype or headlines, but to sketch out drafts of the future.

## 💡 Why are we doing this?

Blockchain isn’t just a trading tool. It can become part of how we **live**.

LXDAO is dedicated to "making valuable projects happen continuously."

We believe that **onchain life scenarios** could become one of the most meaningful and imaginative frontiers in the next five years.

This summer, no business plans, no Web3 whitepapers, just one relaxed yet intentional hackathon to unlock a new narrative of life.

🛠️ **What kind of ideas are we looking for?** (but not limited to these)

- 🏡 Onchain Families: Marriage contracts, family DAOs, onchain kinship relations
- 📜 Onchain Wills & Inheritance: Trustworthy custody and digital legacy mechanisms
- 🐶 Onchain Pets & Identity Systems: Creating unique onchain identities for our furry friends
- 💕 Onchain Love Life: Dating contracts, breakup insurance, couple treasury
- 🧓 Life, Aging, Health & Death: Onchain health data, retirement DAOs, mutual aid for illness
- 🛠️ Urban DAOs & Social Governance: How can local communities operate onchain?
- 🧠 Bolder Ideas: Onchain college applications, rental credit scoring, blockchain memorial halls…

This is a bold, relaxed, and non-grindy hackathon. You don’t need technical mastery—we welcome **cross-disciplinary creativity**.

Even if you don’t code, you can design an interface in Figma, write a proposal, or make a demo video. What we want is **proof of concept + imagination**!
